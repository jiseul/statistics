I'm going to build a statistical model for better marketing

Why?
"We believe that while creating good content for marketing is important, it's also crucial to follow trends by understanding what people are searching for. We thought that platforms like Google and YouTube provide APIs, allowing us to quickly identify trends for free up to a certain level. By using these APIs to gather statistics, we can then define our marketing targets or develop content and products that will increase traffic."

I'm Korean and I'm studying English, but I also use a translator. I appreciate it if you point out any grammatical errors.
